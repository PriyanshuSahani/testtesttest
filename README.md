# **Design Document for On-Demand Logistics Platform**

## **1. Major Design Decisions and Trade-Offs**

### **A. Microservices Architecture**

-   **Design Decision:**  
    The system is built using **microservices** to ensure modularity, scalability, and independent deployment of services like booking, tracking, user management, and pricing.
-   **Trade-Off:**  
    Managing microservices adds operational complexity (e.g., inter-service communication), but it ensures fault isolation and scalability across different modules.

### **B. Asynchronous Communication via Kafka**

-   **Design Decision:**  
    **Apache Kafka** is used for event-driven communication between services to handle tasks like driver updates, booking confirmations, and notifications asynchronously.
-   **Trade-Off:**  
    This adds slight latency in communication but ensures the system remains non-blocking, improving throughput under high loads.

### **C. NoSQL and SQL Databases for Data Handling**

-   **Design Decision:**  
    The system uses **NoSQL** databases (e.g., MongoDB) for real-time vehicle tracking data and **SQL** (e.g., PostgreSQL) for transactional data like bookings and payments.
-   **Trade-Off:**  
    NoSQL offers high write scalability, but querying complex reports is more challenging. SQL ensures ACID compliance where consistency is critical, like payments and user data.

### **D. Load Balancer and WebSocket for Real-Time Data**

-   **Design Decision:**  
    Load balancers distribute traffic across services, and **WebSocket** connections provide real-time communication for vehicle tracking.
-   **Trade-Off:**  
    While WebSocket ensures near-instant updates, maintaining persistent connections increases resource usage.

## **2. Handling High-Volume Traffic and Scalability**

1. **Horizontal Scaling of Microservices**

    - Each service runs independently in **containers** (e.g., Docker) and is managed via **Kubernetes** clusters.
    - **Horizontal scaling** ensures the system can increase capacity by adding more instances during traffic spikes.

2. **Caching with Redis**

    - Frequently accessed data, such as vehicle availability or price estimates, is cached using **Redis**.
    - This reduces load on the main databases and improves response times for users.

3. **Partitioned Databases and Sharding**

    - **NoSQL databases** are **sharded** to handle the massive influx of tracking updates.
    - **SQL databases** are **partitioned** by regions or booking dates, ensuring query performance under heavy loads.

4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
    - To protect the system, rate-limiting mechanisms ensure that no user or driver can overwhelm the system with excessive requests.

## **3. Load Balancing and Distributed Data Handling**

1. **Global Load Balancer (GSLB)**

    - A **Global Load Balancer** ensures user requests are routed to the nearest regional server, minimizing latency.
    - Within each region, **local load balancers** distribute requests to available service instances.

2. **Real-Time Data Handling with Kafka**

    - Kafka handles thousands of **tracking updates** per second by distributing data across multiple partitions.
    - This design ensures **high throughput** without bottlenecking any single service.

3. **WebSocket for Real-Time Communication**

    - Persistent **WebSocket connections** ensure users can track vehicles in real time.
    - The **load balancer** maintains sticky sessions, ensuring users remain connected to the same backend instance throughout their session.

4. **Distributed Data Handling and Replication**
    - **NoSQL** databases are deployed across regions, with **replication** for fault tolerance and availability.
    - **Read replicas** for SQL databases help handle traffic spikes for analytics queries without impacting booking transactions.

## **Conclusion**

This design ensures the system is highly scalable, capable of handling 10,000 concurrent requests per second, and provides real-time tracking for users. By using a mix of **NoSQL and SQL databases**, **Kafka** for asynchronous communication, **load balancing**, and **horizontal scaling**, the platform remains responsive and efficient even under heavy loads. Trade-offs like increased complexity in microservice management and the use of multiple database types are justified by the systemâ€™s ability to deliver high performance, low latency, and fault tolerance.
